/* 
   NOTE: To make the sticky footer work, the Footer component itself needs to be fixed at the bottom 
   with z-index 0, and the main content needs z-index 10 with a margin-bottom equal to footer height.
   
   Since the Footer is in the Root Layout and global, we might need a different approach for just this page 
   OR apply the sticky logic globally.
   
   For now, I will create a localized StickyFooter for the Story page or instruct on layout changes.
